## 1. Description


We created an An App that gives you choices of going out to eat, entertainment or both.
We developed this application for users that struggle with ideas of things to do as well as users who have had to use multiple search options, applications or other websites for ideas.

As a user, I want to be able to search for food, drinks, entertainment or a combination of them in my area using my zip code.
As a user, I want to be able to select the type of food that I am interested in.
As a user, I want should be able to click on the returned information and get more information if applicable.
As a user, I want an application that I can view on my phone.
